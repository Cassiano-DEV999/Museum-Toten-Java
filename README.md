# Museum-Toten-Java
  Olá, este post trás com ele uma ideia realizada pelo grupo da faculdade, uma ideia de museu interativo, porém com um quiz no final

SPA stands for Supervised Practical Activity, and it is a semester-long project done at UNIP, in groups. This one was carried out in the third semester with the objective of creating an interactive kiosk for a museum that has an exhibition of Mars explorer robots. The language used was Java, applying Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

This project is an academic work developed in the context of a supervised practical activity, with the objective of applying theoretical concepts in a real project.
